  <div class = "projectDescription">
  <p>Type: 24-hour Hackathon Project <br>
Team: 2 people (me + a friend)<br>
Tools: Figma, ChatGPT API (conceptually), brainstorming boards<br>
Timeframe: 24 hours<br>
Role: UX/UI Designer & Concept Developer
</p>
</div>
<div class = "continue">
<p>During a 24-hour hackathon, my teammate and I developed an idea for a health-focused mobile app. <br>
  The goal was to design an accessible, AI-powered platform that helps people interpret their blood <br>
   test results in plain language and get lifestyle advice based on their data.
</p>
</div>
<h2 class = "goal">The Problem/Goal</h2>
<div class = "problemStatement">
<p>Many people receive blood test results filled with medical jargon they don’t understand. They either ignore them or turn to unreliable sources online,<br>
   which can increase anxiety and confusion.
Our goal was to create an app that:<br>
     <br>
- Helps users understand their blood test results in clear, simple terms.<br>
- Offers non-medical lifestyle advice to improve health naturally.<br>
- Provides guidance on which doctor to visit and nearest accessible locations if any value looks abnormal.<br>
- Allows users to ask AI health-related questions for reassurance and education.<br>
- Maintain a record of your medical history
</p>
</div>
<h2 class = "process">Process & Iterations</h2>
<div class = "processDescription">
<p>We developed the concept for an app designed to help users enhance their lifestyle and manage minor health concerns,<br>
   particularly for those with busy schedules or limited access to timely medical care. The app provides guidance on lifestyle <br>
   improvements and notifies users when it is advisable to consult a doctor promptly.
</p>
</div>
<div class = "research">
<p>We quickly researched existing apps (like Carrot Care, Ada, and Health Mate) to identify gaps.
</p>
</div>
<h2 class = "insights">Insights:</h2>
<div class = "insightsList">
<p>- Most apps show only data without explanations<br>
- Few apps combine test analysis, AI chat, and actionable advice <br>
- Users want trustworthy yet friendly guidanc.<br>
</p>
</div>
<h2 class = "inform">Information Architecture & Wireframes</h2>
<div class = "informDescription">
<p>We sketched the main flow:<br>
1. Upload/scan your blood test <br>
2. App analyzes results and highlights any issues <br>
3. Personalized advice and doctor recommendation <br>
4. Optional AI chat for follow-up questions <br>

<div class = "designDescription">
<p>We focused on a calm, trustworthy, medical aesthetic—soft blues,greens and red, with icons for clarity. The minimalist logo clearly reflects the app’s core principles and functionality.</p>

<h2 class = "contrib">Contribution</h2>
<div class = "contribDescription">
<p>I was responsible for:<br>
- Defining the core concept and user goals<br>
- Developed the app’s main color palette and logo<br>
- Partially creating wireframes and final UI design in Figma<br>
   <br>
My teammate focused on UI design in Figma as well and AI integration logic
</p>
</div>
<h2 class = "sol">Solutions & Outcome</h2>
<div class = "solDescription">
<p>Our final solution was an interactive app concept that:<br>

- Simplifies complex medical data into clear visuals and explanations<br>
- Warns users when values approach abnormal ranges<br>
- Suggests vitamins and habits to improve results naturally<br>
- Recommends which specialist to visit and suggest the nearest clinics<br>
- Includes a built-in AI medical assistant for minor concerns<br>
</p>
</div>
<h4 class = "outc">Outcome:</h4>
<div class = "outcomeDescription">
<p>
- Positive feedback from hackathon mentors: they appreciated the combination of AI + design empathy <br>
- We completed a Figma prototype within 24 hours<br>
- The app demonstrated potential for real-world health-tech use and could evolve into a start-up project
</p>
</div>
<h2 class = "pers">Personal Reflection</h2>
<div class = "persDescription">
<p>This project taught me how to balance complex information with user-friendly design under time pressure. <br>
  I learned the importance of clear visual hierarchy and trust-building design in health-related products.<br>
If I were to continue the project, I’d conduct usability testing with actual users to validate the clarity of<br>
 explanations and refine the AI chat flow for accessibility.
